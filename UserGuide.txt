              Bird Height Analysis Module Guide     
******************************************************************

# Overview #
Users mark birds loaded into this module so that the next module can
calculate their heights.

# Input fields #
The 'Bird Spreadsheet' is the spreadsheet located in the Bird Height
directory that contains the birds to be analysed. Its name follows
the format of 'Zone01_M01_S01_D01_C1_15_BH_Process'.

The 'SEQ' input is the .seq file for the next bird to be marked.
This should be loaded after the appropriate spreadsheet.

# Module function #
To start, load the bird spreadsheet. All flying birds to be marked
will now appear in the table in the top right of the module. Look at
the Reel Name field for the first bird to be marked, and load the 
appropriate sequence file for this reel. Once the reel is loaded
click the frame number in the table to go to that part of the .seq
file.

If the image is too dark to see clearly you can adjust it from the 
'Brightness' menu in the top left. Birds can be zoomed in and out
on using the zoom toggle buttons in the top left toolbar, and the
image can be panned around while zoomed in using the pan button.

For a selected bird use the 'Next' and 'Previous' frame selection
buttons to find the first frame the flying bird appears on. From 
this first frame, zoom in until you can clearly see head and tail,
then click 'Mark Bird'. The mouse will change to allow you to mark
two points on the image. You can mark either the head or tail first,
as long as you remain consistent for every frame of the bird.

Use mouse left click to place first marker, and then 
mouse left click while holding the shift key to place second marker.

The second marker can be placed any distance in front of the bird, 
and is only to gauge the flight direction.

If the bird has a reflection, then the bird can be marked using the 
reflection method. To do this just click the reflection button on 
the bird you wish to mark, and first select a point on the bird, 
and left click, and then select the same point on the reflection 
and left click. There is no need to click run translation 
the mark points will be automattically saved after you have clicked 
accept to the inputs. This method only requires marking a bird in 1 frame. 

Once the head and tail have been marked, move onto the next frame 
(you can do this automatically by toggling the green arrow in the
top left) and locate the bird's new position. Mark it again on this
frame. Continue until the last frame the bird appears on. Once the
last frame has been marked, click 'Run Translation'. The 'Completed'
column in the table will chance from 'No' to 'Yes', and you can now
procede to the next bird. Be sure to check the Reel Name first.

If you make a mistake when marking a bird, you can click 'Reset Bird'
with that bird selected in the table. If you are unsure which frames
you have already marked, you can click 'Display Markers' to see 
previously marked birds.

If it is not possible to mark a bird for any reason, click 'Not 
Possible'. You will be asked to give a reason so the appropriate 
error code can be assigned. Birds can also be marked as 'Not Done'
by click thing 'Not Done' button.
